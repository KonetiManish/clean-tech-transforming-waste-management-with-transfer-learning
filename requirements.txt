# ðŸ—‘ CleanTech: Smart Waste Classification Using Deep Learning https://your-cleantech-demo-link.netlify.app/
âœ¨ Project Overview

CleanTech is an AI-powered web application that classifies waste as *Biodegradable, **Recyclable, or **Trash* using transfer learning with the VGG16 model. This real-time image classification system promotes sustainable waste management and environmental education.

Developed as part of an applied machine learning initiative, CleanTech integrates deep learning with web technologies to offer a scalable and intuitive solution for smart waste sorting.
# ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- Intelligent Classification: VGG16-based CNN delivers fast and accurate predictions.
- Transfer Learning: Uses pre-trained weights from ImageNet for efficient training.
- Real-Time Prediction: Upload an image and instantly see the predicted waste type.
- Modern Web Interface: Built using Flask and Bootstrap for a clean user experience.
- Expandable Design: Easily scalable to new classes or environments.
